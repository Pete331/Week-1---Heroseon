# Week-1---Heroseon

Homework for week 1: We were given html, css, image files etc. and we had to increase the readability accessabilty and semantics.

The work in HTML:
adding alt tags for images,
renaming some of the classes to be more appropriate,
renamed some div's to more meaningful tag's,
fixed header links not working,
renamed title,
added an error fix css so that compatabilty errors are minimised,

The work in CSS:
changing colours so that contrasts pass for accesibilty reasons,
grouping some classes/id's wth the same attributes,
reordering so that it made more sence to me (the developer),
Making containers more responsive and images/text within these containers,
fixed header to top of page,
